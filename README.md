# Agile Web Development - Project 1

This repo contains three pages, the first one with personal portfolio, second on gives a brief on how the front end web technologies have evolved in short and the third one gives a gist of how these technologies can be used to make some beautifully themed and responsive websites

Technologies used in this project are listed below:
1) HTML
2) CSS
3) JavaScript
4) DOM Manipulation
5) Bootstrap
6) jQuery
7) AJAX
