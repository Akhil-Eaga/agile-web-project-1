                    <h3>A brief history of HTML: 1993 - Present</h3>
                </div>
                <p class = "history-paragraph">
                    Tim Berners Lee wrote the first version of HTML in 1993. Many versions of HTML were developed since then. HTML 4.01 became an official standard in the December of 1999, and was the most widely used version of HTML throughout the 2000’s.
                </p>
                <p class = "history-paragraph">
                    An XML version of HTML was created which was named XHTML. As a standard markup language XML was used to create several other markup languages. The content created in any of these markup languages can be easily across different applications because all these languages are written from XML. W3C created an XML version of HTML, called XHTML. In 2000, XHTML became an official standard which was updated 2 years later in 2002. While HTML is similar to XHTML, it has less restrictions. 
                </p>
                <p class = "history-paragraph">
                    As HTML 4.01 was the standard in 2000’s much of the Web was either built on HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0. During the time of 2010-2011, W3C collaborated with another organization called WHATWG, and worked on developing a newer version of HTML. Even though it was in draft specification, HTML5 was widely supported by browsers and other devices which are capable of accessing the web, and paved the way into the future. The new version was named HTML5 and became an official standard in 2014 and has been the standard since then. 
                </p>
                <p class = "history-paragraph">
                    As new versions emerge, HTML started to support more and more types of content. 
                </p>
                <p class = "history-paragraph">
                    A table is shown below to summarize some of the prominent elements which received support in the newer version of HTML. During the early years of HTML, when web designers wanted to add some unsupported content, they had to use a work around and make use of proprietary, but non-standard software like the Adobe Flash. Many a times, browser plug-ins installation was required to access those content and, in some cases, certain users with devices like iPhone and iPads do not have support to Adobe Flash.
                </p>
                <p class = "history-paragraph">
                    Hence HTML5 added a bunch of new features without relying on that non-standard proprietary software and enabled to do more with just the new version of HTML. 
                </p>

                <p class = "history-paragraph">
                    Hakon Wium Lie was the first to propose CSS on October 10 of 1994. Lie was working with Tim Berners Lee at CERN back at that time. Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed at that time. Bert Bos’s  proposal was an influential one and he became the co-author of CSS1 and has been regarded as the co-creator of CSS in 1996.
                </p>
                <p class = "history-paragraph">
                    Issues that were not addressed in CSS level 1, were tackled by the CSS Working Group resulting in the creation of CSS level 2 on 4th of November in 1997. CSS level 2 was published as a W3C recommendation on 12th May 1998. Development of CSS level 3 started back in 1998 and is the current standard in CSS.

                <p class="history-paragraph">
                    Each version of CSS builds up on the previous version and are named sequentially to denote the versions. Some of the notable advancements in each version are discussed below:

                    <p class = "history-paragraph">
                        This version of CSS brought new features like absolute, relative and fixed positioning of elements, z-index, mediatypes and font shadows.

                    <summary>CSS 2.1</summary>
                    <p class = "history-paragraph">
                        This version of CSS fixed the errors that were present in CSS2 and removed poorly supported or not completely interoperable features and adds already implemented browser extensions to the official specification. CSS 2.1 became official standard on 7th June of 2011
                    </p>
                </details>

                    <summary>CSS 3</summary>
                    <p class = "history-paragraph">
                        Unlike the second version of CSS which is a single large specification, CSS3 is broken down into several documents called modules. Each module added or extended the functionality defined in CSS2 while preserving backward compatibility.

                    <p class = "history-paragraph">
                        There is no one single, integrated CSS4  specification, because it has been split in to different modules and are levelled independently. 
                    </p>
                    <p class = "history-paragraph">
                        CSS Working Group sometimes publishes what are called as “Snapshot” which are essentially a collection of stable enough modules to be implemented by browsers.

                <p class="history-paragraph">
                    JavaScript is ubiquitous (*almost) and is one of the most commonly used programming languages in the world. It comes as no surprise that that it has been ranked “the most commonly used” programming language for 8 years in a row. As of 2019, over 65% of developers employed JavaScript. The rise of JS is sometimes referred synonymously to the rise of internet itself. 
                </p>
                <p class="history-paragraph">
                    JS was created out of necessity and is currently used to build more than 95% of the websites including the giants like Facebook, YouTube and eBay. JS adds a functionality and interactivity to websites and webpages. 
                </p>
                <p class="history-paragraph">
                    During the mid-1990s, key players like Netscape and Microsoft were in the middle of browser war with both the browsers competing neck to neck. In 1995, a programmer from Netscape, Brandan Eich developed a new scripting language in just 10 days (Phew!!!). That first version was named as “Mocha” which later changed to LiveScript and now it is being referred as JavaScript. 
                </p>
                <p class="history-paragraph">
                    Due to the rapid growth of JavaScript, Netscape handled the job of creating a language specification to European Computers Manufacturers Association (ECMA) in 1997.

                    2005 marks a great year for JavaScript because of a paper released by Jesse James Garett who introduced Ajax, which is a revolutionary suite that made use of JS. Ajax makes the webpages looks and feel more like native apps thus improving the user experience. Although at that time, JS faced many challenges, like for example, being verbose to achieve simple tasks, but the community responded by creating popular JS frameworks and libraries like jQuery, Dojo and Mootools.
